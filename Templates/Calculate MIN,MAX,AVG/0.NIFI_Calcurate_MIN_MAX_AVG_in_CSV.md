# NiFi example: Calcurate Min, Max and Avg in a CSV file

Let's calcurate Min, Max and Average value from this CSV file:
```csv
id, value
a, 345
b, 234
c, 1256
```

Using QueryRecord, we can analyze records by SQL! (QueryRecord uses [Apache Culcite](https://calcite.apache.org/docs/reference.html))
```
select
 min("value") as "min",
 max("value") as "max",
 avg("value") as "avg"
from FLOWFILE
```

Result:
```
min,max,avg
234,1256,611
```
